**18 years of enrollment data (2008-2025).** 2.9 million students across
67 county districts in the Sunshine State. Here are ten stories hiding
in the numbers:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 1. Florida is America’s fourth-largest school system

Florida public schools serve nearly 3 million students, trailing only
California, Texas, and New York. One function call pulls it all into R.

``` r
library(flschooldata)
library(dplyr)

enr <- fetch_enr_multi(2014:2025)

enr %>%
  filter(is_state, subgroup == "total_enrollment", grade_level == "TOTAL") %>%
  select(end_year, n_students) %>%
  mutate(change = n_students - lag(n_students))
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 2. Miami-Dade is larger than most states

Miami-Dade County Public Schools, with 340,000+ students, is the
fourth-largest school district in America and enrolls more students than
several entire states.

``` r
enr_2025 <- fetch_enr(2025)

enr_2025 %>%
  filter(is_district, subgroup == "total_enrollment", grade_level == "TOTAL") %>%
  arrange(desc(n_students)) %>%
  head(10) %>%
  select(district_name, n_students)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 3. COVID barely dented Florida enrollment

While other states saw sharp declines, Florida’s enrollment dipped only
briefly in 2021 and has since rebounded, fueled by in-migration from
other states.

``` r
enr <- fetch_enr_multi(2019:2025)

enr %>%
  filter(is_state, subgroup == "total_enrollment", grade_level == "TOTAL") %>%
  select(end_year, n_students) %>%
  mutate(change = n_students - lag(n_students))
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 4. Hispanic students are the plurality

Hispanic students now comprise over 35% of Florida enrollment,
surpassing white students to become the largest demographic group
statewide.

``` r
enr_2025 %>%
  filter(is_state, grade_level == "TOTAL",
         subgroup %in% c("hispanic", "white", "black", "asian", "multiracial")) %>%
  mutate(pct = round(pct * 100, 1)) %>%
  select(subgroup, n_students, pct) %>%
  arrange(desc(n_students))
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 5. Central Florida is the growth engine

Orange, Osceola, and Polk counties in Central Florida have been among
the fastest-growing in the state, driven by the Orlando metro boom.

``` r
enr <- fetch_enr_multi(2014:2025)

enr %>%
  filter(is_district, subgroup == "total_enrollment", grade_level == "TOTAL",
         grepl("Orange|Osceola|Polk", district_name)) %>%
  group_by(district_name) %>%
  summarize(
    y2014 = n_students[end_year == 2014],
    y2025 = n_students[end_year == 2025],
    pct_change = round((y2025 / y2014 - 1) * 100, 1)
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(pct_change))
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 6. Broward and Miami-Dade are declining

South Florida’s two largest districts have been losing students for
years as families relocate to Central Florida or out of state.

``` r
enr <- fetch_enr_multi(2018:2025)

enr %>%
  filter(is_district, subgroup == "total_enrollment", grade_level == "TOTAL",
         grepl("Broward|Miami-Dade", district_name)) %>%
  select(end_year, district_name, n_students) %>%
  tidyr::pivot_wider(names_from = district_name, values_from = n_students)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 7. Florida Virtual School is a district unto itself

Florida Virtual School (FLVS) serves tens of thousands of students
statewide, making Florida a pioneer in virtual education.

``` r
enr_2025 %>%
  filter(is_district, subgroup == "total_enrollment", grade_level == "TOTAL",
         grepl("Virtual|FLVS", district_name, ignore.case = TRUE)) %>%
  select(district_name, n_students)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 8. Kindergarten is the leading indicator

Florida kindergarten enrollment has been relatively stable, unlike
states with sharp K declines–reflecting Florida’s continued population
growth.

``` r
enr <- fetch_enr_multi(2019:2025)

enr %>%
  filter(is_state, subgroup == "total_enrollment",
         grade_level %in% c("K", "01", "05", "09")) %>%
  select(end_year, grade_level, n_students) %>%
  tidyr::pivot_wider(names_from = grade_level, values_from = n_students)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 9. Black students are 22% of enrollment

Florida has a significant Black student population, concentrated in
South Florida and the Jacksonville/North Florida region.

``` r
enr_2025 %>%
  filter(is_district, subgroup == "black", grade_level == "TOTAL") %>%
  mutate(pct = round(pct * 100, 1)) %>%
  arrange(desc(pct)) %>%
  head(10) %>%
  select(district_name, n_students, pct)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 10. Florida has one district per county

Unlike states with hundreds of small districts, Florida has exactly 67
county-based school districts (plus a few special-purpose districts),
making statewide analysis cleaner.

``` r
enr_2025 %>%
  filter(is_district, subgroup == "total_enrollment", grade_level == "TOTAL") %>%
  summarize(
    n_districts = n(),
    total_students = sum(n_students, na.rm = TRUE),
    avg_per_district = round(mean(n_students, na.rm = TRUE))
  )
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Installation

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("almartin82/flschooldata")
```

## Quick start

### R

``` r
library(flschooldata)
library(dplyr)

# Fetch one year
enr_2025 <- fetch_enr(2025)

# Fetch multiple years
enr_multi <- fetch_enr_multi(2020:2025)

# State totals
enr_2025 %>%
  filter(is_state, subgroup == "total_enrollment", grade_level == "TOTAL")

# District breakdown
enr_2025 %>%
  filter(is_district, subgroup == "total_enrollment", grade_level == "TOTAL") %>%
  arrange(desc(n_students))

# Miami-Dade County (district 13)
enr_2025 %>%
  filter(district_id == "13", subgroup == "total_enrollment")
```

### Python

``` python
import pyflschooldata as fl

# Check available years
years = fl.get_available_years()
print(f"Data available: {years['min_year']}-{years['max_year']}")

# Fetch one year
df = fl.fetch_enr(2025)

# Fetch multiple years
df_multi = fl.fetch_enr_multi([2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024, 2025])

# State totals
state_total = df[(df['is_state'] == True) &
                 (df['subgroup'] == 'total_enrollment') &
                 (df['grade_level'] == 'TOTAL')]

# District breakdown
districts = df[(df['is_district'] == True) &
               (df['subgroup'] == 'total_enrollment') &
               (df['grade_level'] == 'TOTAL')].sort_values('n_students', ascending=False)
```

## Data availability

| Years         | Source                 | Notes                              |
|---------------|------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **2014-2025** | FLDOE Membership Files | Full school-level demographic data |
| **2008-2013** | FLDOE FTE Files        | District-level totals only         |

Data is sourced from the Florida Department of Education.

### What’s included

- **Levels:** State, district (67 county + special), school (~4,500)
- **Demographics:** White, Black, Hispanic, Asian, American Indian,
  Pacific Islander, Two or More Races
- **Gender:** Male, Female
- **Grade levels:** Pre-K through 12

### Florida ID system

- **67 county districts:** Codes 01-67 (one per county)
- **Special districts:** Codes 71-75 (lab schools, FL School for
  Deaf/Blind)
- **School numbers:** 4-digit codes
- **Combined ID:** `DD-SSSS` format (e.g., “13-0021” for a Miami-Dade
  school)

### Caveats

- Pre-2014 data has limited demographics (FTE files only)
- Charter school identification not directly available in membership
  files
- ESE, ELL, and free/reduced lunch in separate files (not yet
  integrated)
